# object oriented programming(OOP) allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.
# recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary or other objects, you were able to call methods off them with the .method_name() syntax.
# these methods act as function that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or change the current object.
# for example this includes appending to a list, or counting the occurences of an element in a tuple.
# OOP allows users to create their own objects.
# the general form is often confusing when first encountered and its usefulness may not be completely clear at first.
# in general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized.
# for much larger scripts of python code, functions by themselves aren't enough for organization and repeatability.
# commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with OOP to create code that is more usable.

# SYNTAX
# class NameOfClass():
#     def __init__(self,p1,p2):
#         self.p1=p1
#         self.p2=p2
#     def some_method(self):
#         print(self.p1)
